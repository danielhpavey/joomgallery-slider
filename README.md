# Joomgallery Slider

A super simple lightweight *image slideshow* module for [Joomla!](https://www.joomla.org/)

The module integrates with [Joomgallery](http://www.en.joomgallery.net/).

## Aims

I wanted to create a very lightweight *image slideshow* module that would pull images from a specified category in [Joomgallery](http://www.en.joomgallery.net/).

In addition I wanted the first image to load immediately, but the rest to be deferred and to only be loaded once the the page had completely loaded. Hopefully(!) this would help the performance of the website the module is installed in.
